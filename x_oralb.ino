Charateristics
ToothbrushID

UUID: a0f0ff01-5047-4d53-8208-4f72616c2d42

data: uint32 little endian an id different for each toothbrush??
ModelId

UUID: a0f0ff02-5047-4d53-8208-4f72616c2d42

data: 3 bytes: [modeId, protocolVersion, fwVersion]

Node: protocol version and fwVersion are available only if protocolVersion >=3
UserId

UUID: a0f0ff03-5047-4d53-8208-4f72616c2d42

data: 1 byte current user id, can be change with a simple write
Status

UUID: A0F0FF04-5047-4D53-8208-4F72616C2D42

data: 2 bytes [state, unknown] as in the advertise
Battery level:

UUID: A0F0FF05-5047-4D53-8208-4F72616C2D42

data: 4 bytes [ battery level (%), seconds left (2bytes le), unknown]

Node: seconds left available only with protocol version > 3
Button State:

UUID: a0f0ff06-5047-4d53-8208-4f72616c2d42

data: 2 bytes: [powerButtonState, modeButtonState] , 1 = pressed
Brushing mode

UUID: A0F0FF07-5047-4D53-8208-4F72616C2D42

data: 1 byte -> 0..6 as in the advertise
Brushing time:

UUID: A0F0FF08-5047-4D53-8208-4F72616C2D42

data: 2 bytes [min, sec]
Sector

UUID: a0f0ff09-5047-4d53-8208-4f72616c2d42

data 1 byte -> 0..8 as in the advertise
Control Char

UUID: a0f0ff21-5047-4d53-8208-4f72616c2d42

write here before change some configuration
Current time

UUID: a0f0ff22-5047-4d53-8208-4f72616c2d42

Access: R/W

data: 4 bytes little endian seconds after 1/1/2000

Note: To change it you have to write [0x37,0x26] into the control characteristics before write the new value
Signals

UUID: a0f0ff24-5047-4d53-8208-4f72616c2d42

Access: R/W data: 1 byte: tell the status of the user notification:

    bit 1 = is vibrating (as a sector end)
    bit 2 = is vibrating (as a session end)
    bit 3 = light on (as high pressure)
    bit 4 = light on (as session end)

note: before write it, write [0x37,0x28] in the control characteristics

node: writing is not working :(
Available modes

UUID: a0f0ff25-5047-4d53-8208-4f72616c2d42 Access: R/W

Data: 8 byte, each byte is a possible motor mode, it can be used to reordered the available modes

Note: To change it you have to write [0x37,0x29] into the control characteristics before write the new value
Sector timer

UUID: a0f0ff26-5047-4d53-8208-4f72616c2d42 Access: R/W

Data: 8 uint16 le, timeout for each sector, to update it all the 8 value must be present

Node: write [0x37,0x2A] into the control characteristics before change the values
Session Info

UUID: a0f0ff29-5047-4d53-8208-4f72616c2d42 Access:R

from this value the session data can be read.

To select the session, write [0x02, index] into the control characteristics.

The number of stored session are:

    20 for protocol version 1
    30 for protocol version 2,3,4

Session Format

    Start time: 4 bytes le, seconds after 1/1/2000
    duration : 2 bytes le, duration in seconds
    event count: 1 byte ??
    mode: 1 byte, as in the advertise, mode used for the majority of time during the session
    time under pressure: 2 byte le seconds with the hight pressure warning on
    pressure warnings: 1 byte, # pressure warnings
    final battery state: 1 byte % of battery when the session ends

the last 4 byte has a different meaning with different protocol versions: if protocol version == 1

    last full charge: 4 bytes seconds after 1/1/2000

if protocol version == 2,3,4

    2 byte: as uint16 le, 3 bit = # sector, 13 bit total target time
    2 byte: as uint16 le, 3 bit = # user id, 13 bit session id

if protocol version ==4 time under pressure is in 1/10 seconds
